# PyInstaller build spec for wifit3 — build with: uv run pyinstaller wifit3.spec
#
# Produces a single self-contained onefile binary — dist/wifit3.exe on Windows, dist/wifit3 on
# Linux/macOS. PyInstaller does NOT cross-compile: build each target on that OS.
#
# onefile (active) vs onedir tradeoff:
#   onefile: one binary; unpacks into a temp dir on each launch (slower cold start), trips AV/SmartScreen more.
#   onedir:  a dist/wifit3/ folder; faster start, friendlier to AV, but ships as the whole folder.
# To switch to onedir, swap the EXE/COLLECT blocks at the bottom of this file.
#
# Console app (console=True): Textual needs a real TTY, so a --windowed build would have no
# stdin/stdout and break. The exe closes-on-double-click like any console program — launch from a terminal.

# extraction — so importlib.resources can't see it under libusb_package/ and pyusb falls back to
# a (frozen-broken) system search → "No backend available". Re-add the lib as a DATA file under
# libusb_package/ so it extracts into the package dir where get_library_path() looks. Windows is
# unaffected (its .dll is already collected as data, which keeps its subdir); the Linux .so is not.
