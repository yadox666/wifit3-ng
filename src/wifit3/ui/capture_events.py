"""Detect new capture events (EAPOL frames, handshake completions, PMKID
harvests) by diffing AP state across polls.

Lives between the engine and the views: engines mutate ``AccessPoint``
objects, views poll ``CaptureEventDetector`` once per UI tick and decide
how to render each event. The detector is purely structural (no Rich
markup, no logging) so ScannerView and FocusViewV2 can shape events
differently while sharing dedup state.
