"""Campaign: the radio-owning attack base class.

A campaign owns the half-duplex radio for its lifetime: at most one runs at a
time (the class-level ``active`` slot is the mutex). You ``run()`` a campaign; the
base owns the lifecycle from there: scheduling the work as a task, guaranteeing
``teardown()`` on every exit (natural completion, user stop, or crash), and the
cooperative ``stopped`` flag. So each subclass writes only its *behaviour*:
``_loop()`` + ``teardown()``, plus the ``visible()`` / ``ineligible_reason()``
classmethods the Focus button row derives from.

Engine-pure: no Textual, kept free of any UI dependency so the attack logic
is testable in isolation.

Status/headline/card rendering deliberately stays in ``ui.focus_model`` for now
(read off the active campaign); per-campaign ``status_*`` properties are a
separate, test-guarded pass.
