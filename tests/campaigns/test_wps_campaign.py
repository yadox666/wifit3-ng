"""Campaign sweep logic, driven by a scripted enrollee (no hardware).

The campaign's _try() is overridden to simulate an AP with a known PIN, so we
exercise the COMMON→first-half→second-half progression, the first-half-confirmed
switch, success/PSK capture, and .run resume, without a radio or fake enrollee.
